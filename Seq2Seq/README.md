### Sequence 2 Sequence Architecture ###

Simple sequence 2 sequence architecture using LSTM to sort characters. For eg. 'abfhjke' translates to 'abefhjk' as output. Just after few iteratiosn, learns the sorting perfectly.

Currently, working on extending this architecture (and of course use an embedding layer), to do language translation.
