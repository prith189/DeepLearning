### Object Outline segmentation ###

Implemented as an entry to [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) Kaggle competition

Used ideas from the UNet architecture as described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf

Source code will be uploaded soon.

Sample results after training a basic network:

INPUT IMAGE
